In this repository you will find the scripts created to handle the data used in the end-of-degree project, titled "Classification of astronomical sources through Machine Learning techniques", written by Pablo Gómez Nicolás, directed by Amalia Corral Ramos and co-directed by Francisco Jesús Carrera Troyano. The complete project will be soon available in the University of Cantabria repository https://repositorio.unican.es/. In the thesis, there is an appendix where you will find a summary of the scripts created and their function. In addition, each Python script is properly documented. However, in order to fully understand the operation of each script and the objective of the project, it is recommended to read the thesis.
